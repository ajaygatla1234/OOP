		/*
		 * The ConcurrentModificationException in Java is a runtime exception that occurs when there is a concurrent modification of a collection while it is being iterated or operated upon by another thread or part of the program.
		 * The ConcurrentModificationException is a runtime exception that is thrown in Java when an operation is performed on a collection (e.g. a list, set, or map) while another operation is being performed on the same collection. This can lead to unexpected behavior and can be difficult to debug.
		 * For example, if one thread is iterating over a list using an iterator, and another thread modifies the list (adds, removes, or changes elements), it can lead to inconsistencies and unexpected behavior.
		 * Java provides mechanisms to detect such concurrent modifications. When an operation is detected that violates the expected behavior of the collection during iteration or other operations, Java throws a ConcurrentModificationException.
		 * This exception serves as a warning that the collection is being modified in an unsafe manner while it is being used elsewhere.
		 * ConcurrentModificationExceptions often occur when using iterators on collections. For example, modifying a list directly while iterating over it with an iterator can trigger this exception.
		 * When iterating over collections, use appropriate iterator methods for modification (remove() method of iterators) instead of directly modifying the collection.
		 * More info in Notes.
